# TwitterUndoAutoRefresh
Monitors twitter, when it auto refreshes the timeline, puts the timeline where it was!!

How it works:
grabs a string from the timeline at regular intervals
and checks if the string disapears, 
if it does it scrolls back until the string is visible




F12 and paste the code in the console and run it


By now it kind a works...

TO DO
detect whe the user refreshes the page
detect when the user is not on the timeline
scroll to the exact position where it was

make it as an extension
make it work on android and iOS

Note:
I'm just a hobbyst coder(mostly Python and C).
